# handwriting_recognition

This is a project I worked on with Do Manh Hung, Nguyen Thi Duyen, Nguyen Dinh Viet Anh. This project is part of our "Scientific Research Methods" subject. In this folder, I would like to share the best model we have created for handwriting recognition and a file that saves the model training. Everyone can experience our model through the evalV3.ipynb.
